                        <p>I am a student at Southern Illinois University pursuing a BA in Computer Science. Considering my major, why do I focus on art so much? Well, it’s always what I’ve wanted to do as a kid, but I was always afriad to pursue it. I thought I had to have this magical thing called “talent” to be a good artist, but after talking with other “talented” artists, it turns out that talent may not even be necessary to make great art. In fact, talent may not even exist at all, and with this new understanding of it, I’ve set out on a path to rectify my past dreams, and finally work toward making them a reality.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Now, as badly as I want to become a great artist, I’m not going to just throw my programming knowledge out the window. I understand how vital it is to have programming knowledge in this day and age, and I’ve even found ways to incorporate my programming skills with my art; a perfect example of that being game development.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>This site is a collection of my artwork, including my digital work, traditional work, and even a few video games I’ve made. Feel free to look around!</p>
